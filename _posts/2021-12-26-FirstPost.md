### First Post with Jekyll

>`Hello World!`  

Previously, I used to put my blog posts on Naver blogs, a South Korean blogging platform. 
It was doing its job, but my posts were usually just for daily diary posts.  

And I've always wanted to put up a developer blog where I could share some of my findings and process of learning.
So here I am! With Jekyll and Github Pages.

Hopefully my initial motivation right now can keep me on track to posting regularly ðŸ¤ž.  

To be really honest setting this up was a big hurdle for me as I was **NOT** familiar with Jekyll at all. ðŸ˜µ
Thank you those who have went through similar processes previously, for me to tread upon the accumulated wisdom. Which brings me to think about what to write in my first technical post!  

Stay tuned!
