I thought this was sleek, easy, and neat to put up.So I get onboard the hype train (just me riding it alone in my dark room), and this wasn’t my first time ever trying to install a Jekyll theme properly onto my Github Pages. A little embrassing that I have tried to Jekyll few months back which ended quite abruptly with a disgruntled me, a headache, and more procrastination.Spoiler alert, I succeeded this time.  It Was All Going As PlannedAlthough there was success, I felt the need to share the frustration I had while following the guide in changing the favicon. It may be my lack of knowledge. But I had 0 clue how Jekyll publishes websites (now I can get a sense of it).I wanted to change the cute little Chirpy avatar to something that would represent me more. I was like “Well, there’s a nice little guide on how to change it. How hard could it be ?”    Just Needed One Line of Hint😭So, it turns out that I had no idea files under _site folder gets reproduced every build. Now it seems obvious to me, but back then… not so much. As per instruction, I continuously tried to put my avatar and favicons into _site/assets/favicon since that was the only asset folder I could find. 😂 It got erased everytime, and almost gave me a headache. I now realize that the we needed to put any static content inside assets folder at the root folder. Any content within _site gets rebuilt EVERYTIME.Or any other named folder. While stackoverflow did suggest the above fact, I just didn’t know if I needed to make an assets/ folder to my discretion! (maybe it was somewhere else in the guides, and I missed it)I created and put all my images into the assets/img/ folder, and voila! All was good.  As you can see, the created assets folder contains the static img content. And its image was properly replaced Chirpy.The _sites folder is grey (not tracked by git) which an intelligent person (not me) would obviously fiddle with. But I did. And I was able to learn a few things about Jekyll – the hard way.Aaaand… That’s it!Thanks for reading!Hopefully this was able to help somebody 😁" }, { "title": "First Post", "url": "/posts/FirstPost/", "categories": "DailyBlog, Test", "tags": "it, tech, blog, daily, til", "date": "2021-12-26 20:30:00 +0900", "snippet": "First Post with Jekyll Hello World!Previously, I used to put my blog posts on Naver blogs, a South Korean blogging platform. It was doing its job, but my posts were usually just for daily diary posts.And I’ve always wanted to put up a developer blog where I could share some of my findings and process of learning.So here I am! With Jekyll and Github Pages.Hopefully my initial motivation right now can keep me on track to posting regularly 🤞.To be really honest setting this up was a big hurdle for me as I was NOT familiar with Jekyll at all. 😵Thank you those who have went through similar processes previously, for me to tread upon the accumulated wisdom. Which brings me to think about what to write in my first technical post!Stay tuned!" } ]
